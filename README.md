# GLead

**Hear the key. Find it on the guitar. Fill the space.**

GLead is a free, local-first ear-to-hand trainer for the stuck intermediate
guitarist: the player who knows chord shapes and a pentatonic box but cannot
hear where a progression is going, and improvises by guessing.

The core loop: **hear it → (imagine it) → play it on your guitar → see how you
did → it comes back later in a new key.**

Four linked skills:

1. **Know the key**: scale, diatonic chords, Roman numerals, where they sit on the neck.
2. **Hear the key**: scale degrees, chord function and chord tones by ear.
3. **Find it**: from sound to the right place on the guitar, through the microphone.
4. **Fill the space**: lines over a progression that land on chord tones at the changes.

Not for sale. Success is measured by learning speed, delayed retention and
transfer to unseen keys, computed from the learner's own trial log.

## Status

Early development (Sprint 0–1). See `docs/implementation-plan.md` for the
sprint plan and `docs/prd-concise.md` for the product definition.

## Run it locally

Node 22+ and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173
pnpm verify     # typecheck, lint, format, unit tests, build
```

Mic drills need HTTPS or `localhost` (browsers only grant the microphone in a
secure context) and a real guitar.

## Built on

GLead reuses FretFree's theory, microphone, audio and fretboard modules (MIT),
and follows OpenEar's exercise designs and FretEcho's mic etiquette. See
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `research/`.
